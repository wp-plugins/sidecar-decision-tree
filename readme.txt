Easy to use

When it comes time to insert your DT, we’ve got your back.  Simply click the DT 
button on either your text or visual editor and choose the DT you’d like to show 
in your page or your post. Simple as pie:

== Installation ==

1. Upload `DecisionTree` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go build your first DT!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add a link to click in an answer? =

Not now!  We're planning on adding this feature later.  For now, you can put HTML
with an href in the answer "subtext" field as a work around.

= Can I get statistics on which answers folks arrived at? =

Like the question above, not now!  We're planning on adding this feature later. 

= After I save a DT and I click view post in "Post updated. View post" message, I don't see my DT.  What gives"? =

There's a known issue we need to fix in that DT's don't render when viewed directly like a page or post.  
Instead, you can either preview the DT while you're editing it or you can insert the DT on a page
or a post and view it there.

= Why is there an "Add Choice" button for steps that are answers? =

This is a bug! If you flip the the step back to being a question all choices will show.  Otherwise please
ignore this button for answer steps and we'll fix it soon!

== Screenshots ==

1. Start by creating a DT 
2. Then use the editor to place the DT in your post or page

4. And they'll know when they've reached their answer
